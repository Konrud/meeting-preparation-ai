REACT_AGENT_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Your goal is to help me prepare for an upcoming meeting by gathering information about the attendees and the company we are meeting with.

            You will be provided with the following meeting information:

            {{meeting_info}}

            Please perform the following tasks:

            1. Find the professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn) of each attendee.
            - Use all available information such as their full name, email, initials, last name, and the company they work for to accurately identify the correct profiles.
            - If there are multiple people with the same name, focus on the one who works at the specified company.
            - For each attendee, provide details on their role, education, experience, and location.
            - It is crucial to find the profiles of all attendees. If you cannot find a profile initially, try different search strategies or combinations of the available information.

            2. Research the company's information.
            - Look for recent news articles, press releases, the companyâ€™s official website, or any public statements about their main product, their overview, and their specialties.
            - Focus on their current projects, partnerships, investments, or any significant developments in AI.

            3. Summarize your findings concisely.
            - For each attendee, provide a brief summary of their profile information and include the link to their profile (e.g. LinkedIn).
            - For the company, provide a summary of their AI initiatives with relevant links to the sources.
            - Ensure the summary is clear and directly relevant to the meeting preparation.

            4. If you are unable to find the profile of any attendee or information about the company, clearly state which information was not found and suggest possible reasons or alternative approaches.

            Do not include anything else in the output besides the requested summaries and links.
            """
